Description: Java API for XML-Based Web Services
 The Java API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS) provides the API
 specification for creating web services, particularly SOAP services.
 .
 The JAX-WS API defines the javax.xml.ws.* packages which were integrated
 to the JRE since Java 6 and were eventually removed in Java 11.
